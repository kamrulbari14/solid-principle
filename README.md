# Solid guide to SOLID Principle

This project is a simple documentation aimed at guiding you through the **SOLID Principle** using
real-life examples.

## Guidelines for navigating through the project

This documentation is organized into five (5) different packages, each corresponding to one of the
SOLID principles. Each package contains two (2) sub-packages: `following` and `violating`.

### Packages:

1. **srp (Srp)**: Single Responsibility Principle
2. **ocp (Ocp)**: Open-Closed Principle
3. **lsp (Lsp)**: Liskov Substitution Principle
4. **isp (Isp)**: Interface Segregation Principle
5. **dsp (Dsp)**: Dependency Inversion Principle

### Sub-packages:

- **following**: Contains examples of classes following the specified principle.
- **violating**: Demonstrates how the specific principle is violated. Comments within the violating
  package describe the violations with *****dangling comments*****.

### Steps to follow:

1. Navigate to the package corresponding to the SOLID principle you want to explore.
2. Explore the `violating` sub-package to understand how the principle is violated, with
   accompanying explanations.
3. Refer to the `following` sub-package to see how the issues have been resolved, maintaining the
   principle.

**Note:**

- This documentation aims to provide clear examples and explanations to help you understand and
  apply the ****SOLID**** principles effectively.
- Updates and enhancements will be made periodically to improve clarity and usefulness. Stay tuned
  for further improvements.
